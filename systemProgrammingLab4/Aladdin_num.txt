5 | PEDDLER:    Oh I come from a land
6 |     From a faraway place
7 |     Where the caravan camels roam
8 |     Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense
9 |     If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense
10 |     It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
11 |     When the wind's at your back
12 |     And the sun's from the west
13 |     And the sand in the glass is right
14 |     Come on down,
15 |     Stop on by
16 |     Hop a carpet and fly
17 |     To another Arabian night!
18 | 
19 |     Arabian nights
20 |     Like Arabian days
21 |     More often than not
22 |     Are hotter than hot
23 |     In a lot of good ways
24 | 
25 |     Arabian nights
26 |     'Neath Arabian moons
27 |     A fool off his guard
28 |     Could fall and fall hard
29 |     Out there on the dunes.
30 | 
31 |     Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
32 |     Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
33 |     peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera
34 |     zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of
35 |     mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this
36 |     side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down!
37 |     Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and
38 |     coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break
39 |     (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it
40 |     broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I
41 |     have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the
42 |     famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,
43 |     makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins
44 |     to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,
45 |     don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only
46 |     interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you
47 |     would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER
48 |     pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be
49 |     fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many
50 |     things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside
51 |     that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.
52 |     Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary
53 |     lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life.
54 |     A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he
55 |     seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like
56 |     to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
57 |     lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
58 |     throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry
59 |     nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark
60 |     purpose.
61 | 
62 | (Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
63 |     on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)
64 | 
65 | JAFAR:  You...are late.
66 | GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.
67 | JAFAR:  You have it, then?
68 | GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out
69 |         half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it,
70 |         but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!
71 |         (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch!
72 | JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's
73 |         coming to you.
74 | IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk!
75 | 
76 | (JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects
77 |     them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it
78 |     flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off
79 |     towards the dunes.)
80 | 
81 | JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!
82 | 
83 | (All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until
84 |     it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the
85 |     halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing
86 |     points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise
87 |      up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing
88 |     points serving as the eyes.)
89 | 
90 | JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave
91 |         of wonders!
92 | IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!
93 | GAZEEM: By Allah!
94 | JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the
95 |         treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!
96 | 
97 | (GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the
98 |     entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)
99 | 
100 | IAGO:   Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and
101 |     JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.)
102 |     Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
103 | 
104 | (JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches
105 |     the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking.)
106 | 
107 | CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
108 | GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
109 | CAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose
110 |         worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.
111 | 
112 | (GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)
113 | 
114 | JAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!
115 | 
116 | (GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With
117 |     great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens.
118 |       Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes.
119 |      He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune
120 |     collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO,
121 |      and the two separated halves of the medallion.)
122 | 
123 | CAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.
124 | 
125 | (IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)
126 | 
127 | IAGO:       I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're
128 |         never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just
129 |         forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so
130 |         ticked off that I'm molting!  (He flies up to
131 |         JAFAR's shoulder.)
132 | JAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously
133 |         less than worthy.
134 | IAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big
135 |         surprise.  That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have
136 |         a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What're
137 |         we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-
138 |         (JAFAR pinches his beak shut.)
139 | JAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this
140 |         one, this...diamond in the rough.
141 | 
142 | (Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying
143 |     a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)
144 | 
145 | GUARD:  Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,
146 |         street rat!
147 | ALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All
148 |         this for a loaf of bread?
149 | 
150 | (He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with
151 |     drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits
152 |     and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's
153 |     nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches
154 |      out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the
155 |     shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by
156 |     numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls
157 |      off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread
158 |     when...)
159 | 
160 | GUARD 1:    There he is!
161 | GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy!
162 | ALADDIN:    You think that was easy?
163 | 
164 | (He looks at three women, laughing at him.)
165 | 
166 | GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll
167 |         find him.
168 | 
169 | (ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.
170 |     He rushes over to the women.)
171 | 
172 | ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.
173 | WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't
174 |         we Aladdin?
175 | ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you
176 |         get caught--
177 | 
178 | (A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the
179 |     first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)
180 | 
181 | ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble!
182 | GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,
183 |         then the guard's turban is pulled down over his
184 |         eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)
185 | ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!
186 | ABU:        Hello!
187 | ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here!
188 |         Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline
189 |         One swing ahead of the sword
190 |         I steal only what I can't afford
191 |         That's everything!
192 | 
193 | (ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of
194 |     swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the
195 |     GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN,
196 |     but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD
197 |      pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)
198 | 
199 |         One jump ahead of the lawmen
200 |         That's all, and that's no joke
201 |         These guys don't appreciate I'm broke!
202 | 
203 | (ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down
204 |     on top of another GUARD.)
205 | 
206 | GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
207 |         Scoundrel! Take that!
208 | ALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!
209 | 
210 | (ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the
211 |     platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)
212 | 
213 | GUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!
214 | ALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
215 |         You're my only friend, Abu!
216 | WOMEN:  Who?!?
217 | 
218 | (ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's
219 |     hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.)
220 | 
221 |         Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
222 |         He's become a one-man rise in crime
223 | 
224 | (ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a
225 |     chipmunk.)
226 | 
227 | WOMAN:  I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!
228 | ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
229 |         Tell you all about it when I got the time!
230 | 
231 | (ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The
232 |     GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,
233 |      matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)
234 | 
235 |         One jump ahead of the slowpokes
236 |         One skip ahead of my doom
237 |         Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
238 |         One jump ahead of the hitmen
239 |         One hit ahead of the flock
240 |         I think I'll take a stroll around the block.
241 | 
242 | (A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,
243 |     race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of
244 |     nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU
245 |      disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him.
246 | 
247 | CROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!
248 |         Outrage! Scandal!
249 | ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty
250 | 
251 | (ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
252 |     and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)
253 | 
254 | LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty
255 | 
256 | (ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting
257 |     like they're all chums.)
258 | 
259 | ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
260 |         Otherwise we'd get along!
261 | GUARDS: WRONG!
262 | 
263 | (They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and
264 |     ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run
265 |     across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down,
266 |     screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU
267 |     pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword
268 |     out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards,
269 |     who retreat in fear.)
270 | 
271 | GUARD 1:    He's got a sword!
272 | GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!!
273 | 
274 | (ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are
275 |     once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
276 |       He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street,
277 |      as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)
278 | 
279 | ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
280 | CROWD:  Vandal!
281 | ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!
282 | CROWD:  Street rat!
283 | ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster
284 | CROWD:  Scoundrel!
285 | ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster
286 | CROWD:  Take that!
287 | 
288 | (The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a
289 |      carpet and jumps out the window)
290 | 
291 | ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in
292 |         Wish me happy landin'
293 |         All I gotta do is jump!
294 | 
295 | (The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to
296 |      the street, and land in a pile with the sign "Crazy Hakim's
297 |     Discount Fertilizer."  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
298 |     to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
299 |     other.)
300 | 
301 | ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!
302 | 
303 | (ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins
304 |     to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children
305 |     rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then
306 |     drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then
307 |     the bread, then at ABU.)
308 | 
309 | ABU:        Uh-oh!
310 | 
311 | (ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
312 |     over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)
313 | 
314 | ALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.
315 | 
316 | (The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,
317 |     then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his
318 |      bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)
319 | 
320 | ABU:        Ah, don't.  Huh?
321 | 
322 | (ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade
323 |     going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees
324 |     PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)
325 | 
326 | BYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.
327 | BYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.
328 | 
329 | (ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the
330 |     alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE's horse,
331 |     startling it.)
332 | 
333 | PRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!
334 | 
335 | (The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
336 |     jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)
337 | 
338 | ALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners
339 | PRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!
340 | 
341 | (The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)
342 | 
343 | ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a
344 |         horse with two rear ends!
345 | 
346 | (The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)
347 | 
348 | PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a
349 |         street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only
350 |         your fleas will mourn you.
351 | 
352 | (ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut
353 |     in his face.)
354 | 
355 | ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come
356 |         on, Abu.  Let's go home.
357 | 
358 | (ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in
359 |     ABU for the night.)
360 | 
361 | ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.
362 |         I don't buy that.
363 |         If only they'd look closer
364 |         Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.
365 |         They'd find out, there's so much more to me.
366 | 
367 | (He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)
368 | 
369 |         Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be
370 |         rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems
371 |         at all.
372 | 
373 | (Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.
374 |      The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the
375 |     rear end of his pants.)
376 | 
377 | PRINCE: I've never been so insulted!
378 | 
379 | SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are
380 |         you?
381 | 
382 | PRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!
383 | 
384 | SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes
385 |         off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He
386 |         finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's
387 |         pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece
388 |         of the PRINCE's undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN
389 |         grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH's mouth.)
390 |         Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed
391 |         stormed out!
392 | JASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,
393 |         weren't you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows
394 |         JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing
395 |         with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
396 |         weren't you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the
397 |         moment, until she looks up at her angry father. )
398 |         Ahem.
399 | SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor
400 |         that comes to call.  The law says you...
401 | BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.
402 | 
403 | (They walk over to a dove cage.)
404 | 
405 | SULTAN: By your next birthday.
406 | JASMINE:    The law is wrong.
407 | SULTAN: You've only got three more days!
408 | JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes
409 |         a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry,
410 |         I want it to be for love.
411 | SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him
412 |         the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not
413 |         going to be around forever, and I just want to make
414 |         sure you're taken care of, provided for.
415 | JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my
416 |         own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the
417 |         pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real
418 |         friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.)
419 |         Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to
420 |         sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace
421 |         walls.
422 | SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess.
423 | JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She
424 |         splashes the water.)
425 | SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any
426 |         daughters!
427 | 
428 | (RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove
429 |     cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom.
430 |       She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.)
431 | 
432 | SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother
433 |         wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him.
434 |         He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh.
435 |         Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in
436 |         desperate need of your wisdom.
437 | JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)
438 | SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to
439 |         choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.
440 | IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.
441 | SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He
442 |         pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks
443 |         terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's
444 |         mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR
445 |         and the SULTAN both laugh.)
446 | JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
447 |         (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can
448 |         divine a solution to this thorny problem.
449 | SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
450 | JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue
451 |         diamond.
452 | SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for
453 |         years.
454 | JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
455 |         (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on
456 |         the second syllable, "cess."  He turns his staff
457 |         with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of
458 |         the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's
459 |         voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes
460 |         get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything
461 |         will be fine.
462 | SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.
463 | JAFAR:  The diamond.
464 | SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.
465 | 
466 | (The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
467 |     to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)
468 | 
469 | JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and
470 |         play with your little toys.
471 | SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.
472 | 
473 | (JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room,
474 |     the parrot spits out the cracker.)
475 | 
476 | IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on
477 |         one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!
478 |         Whack!
479 | 
480 | (JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)
481 | 
482 | JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.
483 | IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
484 | JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not
485 |         that addlepated twit.
486 | IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha
487 |         ha!
488 | 
489 | (The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens
490 |     at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE
491 |     in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.
492 |       She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)
493 | 
494 | JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and
495 |         have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She
496 |         begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,
497 |         who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye!
498 | 
499 | (She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN
500 |     and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the
501 |     awning of a fruit stand.)
502 | 
503 | ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!
504 | 
505 | (ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)
506 | 
507 | PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds
508 |             will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and
509 |             hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey,
510 |             get your paws off that.
511 | ABU:            Blah blah blah!
512 | PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!
513 | 
514 | (He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN
515 |     dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)
516 | 
517 | ABU:            Bye bye!
518 | 
519 | (He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,
520 |     where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like
521 |     he has just done this.)
522 | 
523 | ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.
524 | 
525 | (ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J
526 |     ASMINE walking through the street.)
527 | 
528 | SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass
529 |             or silver.
530 | SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar
531 |             dates and pistachios!
532 | SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty
533 |             necklace for a pretty lady.
534 | 
535 | (She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust
536 |     into her face.)
537 | 
538 | SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
539 | JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into
540 |         a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his
541 |         fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches
542 |         fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is
543 |         pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her,
544 |         and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm
545 |         really very sorry.
546 | ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!
547 | 
548 | (She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and
549 |     jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
550 |     face.)
551 | 
552 | ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?
553 | 
554 | (JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child
555 |     reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to
556 |     him.)
557 | 
558 | JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The
559 |             boy runs off.)
560 | PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that.
561 | JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?
562 | PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!
563 | JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money.
564 | PROPRIETOR: Thief!
565 | JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
566 |             get some from the Sultan.
567 | PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
568 | 
569 | (He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to
570 |     chop it off.)
571 | 
572 | JASMINE:        No, no please!
573 | 
574 | (The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.)
575 | 
576 | ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found
577 |             her. I've been looking all over for you.
578 | JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?
579 | ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.
580 | PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?
581 | JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little
582 |             crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear.
583 |             She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by
584 |             the vest.)
585 | PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!
586 | ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
587 | 
588 | (ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.
589 |     JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)
590 | 
591 | JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?
592 | ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.
593 | ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking
594 |             up another apple from the cart with his
595 |             foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to
596 |             Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the
597 |             doctor.
598 | JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.
599 |             How are you?
600 | ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose
601 |             pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.
602 | 
603 | (ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls
604 |     out.)
605 | 
606 | PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can
607 |             carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here,
608 |             you little thieves!
609 | 
610 | (Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre
611 |     contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)
612 | 
613 | IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your
614 |         rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
615 | JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the
616 |         SULTAN's ring in the contraption.)
617 | IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.
618 | 
619 | (IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing
620 |     into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)
621 | 
622 | JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can
623 |         enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of
624 |         Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it
625 |         shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by
626 |         JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes!
627 |         There he is.  My diamond in the rough!
628 | IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been
629 |         waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked
630 |         into the gears.)
631 | JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to
632 |         the palace, shall we?
633 | 
634 | (IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)
635 | 
636 | IAGO:   Swell.
637 | 
638 | (JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
639 |     ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing
640 |     to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)
641 | 
642 | ALADDIN:    Almost there.
643 | 
644 | (JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
645 |     She stands up.)
646 | 
647 | JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.
648 | ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is
649 |         your first time in the marketplace, huh?
650 | 
651 | (ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)
652 | 
653 | JASMINE:    Is it that obvious?
654 | ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,
655 |         still in love.  She returns the look.  But he
656 |         realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.)
657 |         I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous
658 |         Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the
659 |         buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned
660 |         down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in
661 |         surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both
662 |         ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.)
663 | JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner.
664 | ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof
665 |         of a building, dodging planks and beams as they
666 |         go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful.
667 | JASMINE:    Is this where you live?
668 | ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
669 | JASMINE:    Fabulous.
670 | ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and
671 |         exposes the palace) but it's got a great view.
672 |         Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
673 | JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful.
674 | ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to
675 |         have servants and valets...
676 | JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how
677 |         to dress.
678 | ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food
679 |         and ducking the guards.
680 | JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.
681 | ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--
682 | JASMINE:    You're just--
683 | BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.
684 | 
685 | (They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one
686 |     another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the
687 |     look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his
688 |     arm into the hand of JASMINE.)
689 | 
690 | ALADDIN:    So, where're you from?
691 | JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not
692 |         going back.
693 | ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his
694 |         hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted
695 |         look on his face.)
696 | ABU:        Why you!
697 | 
698 | (ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)
699 | 
700 | JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married.
701 | ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the
702 |         princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!
703 | 
704 | (ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)
705 | 
706 | JASMINE:    What?
707 | ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
708 | ABU:        What?
709 | JASMINE:    Oh did he?
710 | ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.
711 | JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?
712 | ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do
713 |         to help.
714 | ABU:        Oh, boy!
715 | JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.
716 | 
717 | (ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until
718 |     ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however,
719 |     by the GUARDS, who have found them.)
720 | 
721 | GUARD:  Here you are!
722 | ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're
723 |                 after you?
724 | JASMINE:    My father must have sent them--
725 | ALADDIN:    Do you trust me?
726 | JASMINE:    What?
727 | ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
728 | JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)
729 | ALADDIN:    Then jump!
730 | 
731 | (They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They
732 |     try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)
733 | 
734 | GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we,
735 |         street rat?
736 | 
737 | (Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are
738 |     here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
739 |      throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)
740 | 
741 | GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy.
742 | ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!
743 | JASMINE:    Let go of him.
744 | GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
745 |         have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her
746 |         down.)
747 | JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)
748 |         Unhand him, by order of the princess.
749 | 
750 | (The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)
751 | 
752 | GUARD:  Princess Jasmine.
753 | ALADDIN:    The princess?
754 | ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
755 | GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with
756 |         this street rat?
757 | JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release
758 |         him!
759 | GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from
760 |         Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him.
761 | 
762 | (The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)
763 | 
764 | JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I
765 |         will.
766 | 
767 | (Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He
768 |     slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming
769 |     in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside
770 |     the door frame.)
771 | 
772 | JASMINE:    Jafar?
773 | JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.
774 | IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!
775 | JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his
776 |         cape, hiding the door.)
777 | JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your
778 |         orders.
779 | JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in
780 |         Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.
781 | JASMINE:    What was the crime?
782 | IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar!
783 | JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
784 | IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
785 |         door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!
786 | JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
787 | JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why
788 |         frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known.
789 | JASMINE:    What do you mean?
790 | JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried
791 |         out.
792 | JASMINE:    What sentence?
793 | JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)
794 |         By beheading.
795 | JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)
796 | JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.
797 | JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)
798 | 
799 | (IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on
800 |     JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)
801 | 
802 | IAGO:       So, how did  it go?
803 | JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a
804 |         sinister smile on their faces.)
805 | 
806 | (Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH
807 |     comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)
808 | 
809 | JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his
810 |         name.
811 | 
812 | (Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see
813 |     ALADDIN chained to the wall.)
814 | 
815 | ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe
816 |         it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.
817 | ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!
818 | 
819 | (ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)
820 | 
821 | ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.
822 | 
823 | (ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He
824 |      wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an
825 |      imitation of the princess.)
826 | 
827 | ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.
828 | 
829 | (ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools
830 |     out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)
831 | 
832 | ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
833 | ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a
834 |         street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's
835 |         gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.
836 | 
837 | (ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)
838 | 
839 | ABU:        Ta da!
840 | ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
841 | OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
842 | 
843 | (We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
844 |     have seen before.)
845 | 
846 | ALADDIN:    Who are you?
847 | OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,
848 |         perhaps we can be more.
849 | ALADDIN:    I'm listening.
850 | OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled
851 |         with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
852 |         Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd
853 |         wager.
854 | 
855 | (Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word
856 |     'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation
857 |      of "PRIN-cess."   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks
858 |     his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)
859 | 
860 | IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!
861 | ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--
862 | OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?
863 |         Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins,
864 |         showing a hideously bad mouth.)
865 | ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful
866 |         treasure with me?
867 | OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
868 |         back to go in after it.
869 | ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?
870 | 
871 | (The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)
872 | 
873 | OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they
874 |         seem.  So, do we have a deal?
875 | 
876 | (ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)
877 | 
878 | ABU:        Oh, hmm.
879 | 
880 | (Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
881 |     OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)
882 | 
883 | CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
884 | ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.
885 | CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.
886 | 
887 | (The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of
888 |     ALADDIN. )
889 | 
890 | OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then
891 |         you shall have your reward.
892 | ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of
893 |         his vest.)
894 | 
895 | (ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom
896 |     and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)
897 | 
898 | ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!
899 | ABU:        Uh oh!
900 | ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer
901 |         than the sultan!
902 | 
903 | (ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)
904 | 
905 | ALADDIN:    Abu!
906 | 
907 | (ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)
908 | 
909 | ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.
910 | 
911 | (They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises
912 |     off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling
913 |     they're being followed.)
914 | 
915 | ABU:        Huh?
916 | 
917 | (He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and
918 |     the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the
919 |      CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU
920 |      runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)
921 | 
922 | ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!
923 | ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?
924 | 
925 | (Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet
926 |     jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
927 |     ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other
928 |      side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches
929 |     down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits
930 |     thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his
931 |      face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles
932 |      ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)
933 | 
934 | ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?
935 | 
936 | (The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)
937 | 
938 | ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna
939 |         hurt you.
940 | 
941 | (The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
942 |     it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to
943 |      him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.)
944 | 
945 | ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.
946 | 
947 | (The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes
948 |     his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")
949 | 
950 | ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help
951 |         us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies
952 |         over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You
953 |         see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET
954 |         motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows
955 |         where it is.
956 | 
957 | (They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant
958 |     underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar,
959 |      with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water
960 |      with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of
961 |     the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)
962 | 
963 | ALADDIN:    Wait here!
964 | ABU:        Oh.  Huh?
965 | 
966 | (ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a
967 |     giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the
968 |      stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain
969 |      to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)
970 | 
971 | ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down
972 |         here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free
973 |         of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-
974 |         NO!
975 | 
976 | (ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to
977 |     shake.)
978 | 
979 | CAVE VOICE: Infidels!
980 | ABU:            Uh oh!
981 | CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU
982 |                places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel
983 |                 and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you
984 |                 will never again see the light of day!
985 | 
986 | (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
987 |     skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into
988 |      lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears
989 |     and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the
990 |     bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
991 |     Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock
992 |      is exploding.)
993 | 
994 | ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!
995 | 
996 | (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling
997 |     debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)
998 | 
999 | ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off
1000 |         his head and sees they are flying into a wall.)
1001 |         Start panicking.
1002 | 
1003 | (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they
1004 |     emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to
1005 |      growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a
1006 |     boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs
1007 |     onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top,
1008 |     within reach.)
1009 | 
1010 | ALADDIN:    Help me out!
1011 | OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!
1012 | ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
1013 | OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!
1014 | 
1015 | (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a
1016 |     nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)
1017 | 
1018 | OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!
1019 | 
1020 | (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD
1021 |      MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)
1022 | 
1023 | ALADDIN:    What are you doing?
1024 | OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his
1025 |         normal voice.) Your eternal reward.
1026 | 
1027 | (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
1028 |     ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,
1029 |      who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as
1030 |      well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a
1031 |      boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races
1032 |      up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several
1033 |     times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one
1034 |     final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off
1035 |      his disguise.)
1036 | 
1037 | JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't
1038 |         find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!!
1039 | 
1040 | (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next
1041 |     to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)
1042 | 
1043 | SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?
1044 | JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She
1045 |         looks as if she's been crying.)
1046 | SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right.
1047 |         Now, tell me everything.
1048 | 
1049 | (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.
1050 |     ABU tries to wake him.)
1051 | 
1052 | ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.
1053 | 
1054 | (CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)
1055 | 
1056 | ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)
1057 |         We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the
1058 |         entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer)
1059 |         Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
1060 | ABU:        Aha!
1061 | 
1062 | (ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)
1063 | 
1064 | ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a
1065 |         beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think
1066 |         there's something written here, but it's hard to
1067 |         make out.
1068 | 
1069 | (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the
1070 |     LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the
1071 |     LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)
1072 | 
1073 | GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya
1074 |         such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a
1075 |         nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins
1076 |         it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a
1077 |         ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be
1078 |         outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as
1079 |         a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
1080 |         gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in
1081 |         ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?
1082 | ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
1083 | GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something
1084 |         major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with
1085 |         ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The
1086 |         sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.)
1087 |         Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can
1088 |         we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how
1089 |         bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog
1090 |         wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy!
1091 |         C'mon, Laddi!'
1092 | ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
1093 |         than I thought.
1094 | GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog
1095 |         poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU
1096 |         screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I
1097 |         didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen
1098 |         you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo!
1099 |         Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE.
1100 |         GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller
1101 |         than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either
1102 |         that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the
1103 |         side--do I look different to you?
1104 | ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
1105 | GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
1106 |         mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can
1107 |         be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold
1108 |         Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a
1109 |         cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with
1110 |         a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside)
1111 |         but never duplicated--
1112 | 
1113 | (He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.)
1114 | 
1115 | DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,
1116 |             duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated,
1117 |             duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
1118 | GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
1119 |         Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed
1120 |         Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right
1121 |         here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.
1122 |         Thank youuuuu!
1123 | ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
1124 | GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the
1125 |         wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot
1126 |         machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in
1127 |         the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE
1128 |         caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres.
1129 |         (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No
1130 |         substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck
1131 |         drops with the secret word "Refunds.'
1132 | ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
1133 | GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't
1134 |         think you quite realize what you've got here! So
1135 |         why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate
1136 |         the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a
1137 |         fluorescent light)
1138 | 
1139 |     Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
1140 |     Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
1141 |     But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve
1142 |     You got a brand of magic never fails!
1143 | 
1144 | (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
1145 |     GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes
1146 |     the thieves into submission.)
1147 | 
1148 |     You got some power in your corner now
1149 |     Some heavy ammunition in your camp
1150 |     You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
1151 |     See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
1152 |     And I'll say
1153 | 
1154 | (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged
1155 |     by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
1156 |     explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's
1157 |      hand and rubs lamp with it.)
1158 | 
1159 |     Mister Aladdin sir
1160 |     What will your pleasure be?
1161 |     Let me take your order, jot it down
1162 |     You ain't never had a friend like me
1163 |     No no no!
1164 | 
1165 | (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a
1166 |     note pad, like a waiter. )
1167 | 
1168 |     Life is your restaurant
1169 |     And I'm your maitre' d!
1170 |     C'mon whisper what it is you want
1171 |     You ain't never had a friend like me.
1172 | 
1173 | (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
1174 |     but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
1175 |      into four duplicate GENIEs.)
1176 | 
1177 |     Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
1178 |     You're the boss, the king, the shah!
1179 |     Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
1180 |     How about a little more Baklava?
1181 | 
1182 | (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
1183 |     appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
1184 |     and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
1185 |     screen with baklava.)
1186 | 
1187 |     Try some of column 'A'
1188 |     Try all of column 'B'
1189 |     I'm in the mood to help you dude
1190 |     You ain't never had a friend like me
1191 | 
1192 | (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
1193 |     then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
1194 |     and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
1195 |     and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
1196 |      dressed like a magician comes out.)
1197 | 
1198 | (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
1199 |     hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
1200 |     him into nothing.)
1201 | 
1202 |     Can your friends do this?
1203 |     Do your friends do that?
1204 |     Do your friends pull this out their little hat
1205 |     Can your friends go poof!
1206 |     Well looky here
1207 |     Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
1208 |     And then make the sucker disappear?
1209 | 
1210 | (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
1211 |     He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
1212 |     one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
1213 |      the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
1214 |      himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
1215 |      until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
1216 |     a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
1217 |      The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
1218 |     who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
1219 |      they disappear.)
1220 | 
1221 |     So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
1222 |     I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
1223 |     You got me bona fide, certified
1224 |     You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs!
1225 |     I got a powerful urge to help you out
1226 |     So what you wish I really want to know
1227 |     You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt
1228 |     So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!
1229 | 
1230 | 
1231 | (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a
1232 |     certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls
1233 |      a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
1234 |     to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)
1235 | 
1236 |     Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
1237 |     I'm on the job, you big nabob
1238 |     You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
1239 |     You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
1240 |     You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me!
1241 |     You ain't never had a friend like me!
1242 | 
1243 | (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
1244 |      She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into
1245 |     existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,
1246 |      and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold
1247 |      as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
1248 |     zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a
1249 |     neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and
1250 |     sees that is is empty.)
1251 | 
1252 | GENIE:  So what'll it be, master?
1253 | ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
1254 | GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a
1255 |         few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos
1256 | ALADDIN:    Like?
1257 | GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He
1258 |         slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't
1259 |         ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love
1260 |         with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of
1261 |         lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there.
1262 |         (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a
1263 |         zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from
1264 |         the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs
1265 |         ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He
1266 |         poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got
1267 |         it!
1268 | ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You
1269 |         mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all
1270 |         powerful genie--can't even bring people back from
1271 |         the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even
1272 |         get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna
1273 |         have to find a way out of here--
1274 | 
1275 | (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of
1276 |     them.)
1277 | 
1278 | GENIE:  Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at
1279 |         me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did
1280 |         you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're
1281 |         walkin' out on me?  (Gets madder and madder) I
1282 |         don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your
1283 |         wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET.
1284 |         GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of
1285 |         arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of
1286 |         emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
1287 |         here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
1288 |         here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside
1289 |         the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here!
1290 | 
1291 | (The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off
1292 |     into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is
1293 |     there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)
1294 | 
1295 | SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all
1296 |         your years of loyal service... . From now on,
1297 |         you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,
1298 |         before they are beheaded.
1299 | JAFAR:  I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again.
1300 | SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy
1301 |         business behind us.  Please?
1302 | JAFAR:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as
1303 |         well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
1304 |         she yanks it away.)
1305 | JASMINE:    At least some good will come of my being forced to
1306 |         marry.  When I am queen, I will have the
1307 |         power to get rid of you.
1308 | SULTAN: That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine,
1309 |         getting back to this suitor business, (he
1310 |         looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine?
1311 |         Jasmine!  (He runs after her.)
1312 | JAFAR:  If only I had gotten that lamp!
1313 | IAGO:       (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
1314 |         you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing
1315 |         up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the
1316 |         rest of our lives...
1317 | JAFAR:  No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband.
1318 |         Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!
1319 | BOTH:       Eeewww!
1320 | IAGO:       (Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
1321 |         Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband?
1322 | JAFAR:  (He looks at IAGO in insult)  What?
1323 | IAGO:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh,
1324 |         you become sultan!
1325 | JAFAR:  Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has
1326 |         merit!
1327 | IAGO:       Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and
1328 |         the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the
1329 |         floor)  Kersplat!
1330 | JAFAR:  Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!
1331 | 
1332 | (Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is
1333 |     coming in for a landing.)
1334 | 
1335 | GENIE:  (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic
1336 |         Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand
1337 |         until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As
1338 |         ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by
1339 |         CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you!
1340 |         Good bye!  (Back to normal)  Well, now.  How about
1341 |         that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?
1342 | ALADDIN:    Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-
1343 | GENIE:  Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by
1344 |         ONE, boy!
1345 | ALADDIN:    Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the
1346 |         cave.  You did that on your own.
1347 | 
1348 | (GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a
1349 |     sheep.)
1350 | 
1351 | GENIE:  Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you
1352 |         baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.
1353 | ALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be
1354 |         good.  (To GENIE) What would you wish for?
1355 | 
1356 | (GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)
1357 | 
1358 | GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in
1359 |         my case, ah, forget it.
1360 | ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me.
1361 | GENIE:  Freedom.
1362 | ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner?
1363 | GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig.
1364 |         (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic
1365 |         powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.)
1366 |         Itty bitty living space
1367 | ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible.
1368 | GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not
1369 |         have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do
1370 |         you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own
1371 |         master, such a thing would be greater than all the
1372 |         magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But
1373 |         what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real
1374 |         here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and
1375 |         smell the hummus
1376 | ALADDIN:    Why not?
1377 | GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master
1378 |         wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's
1379 |         happened.
1380 | ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free.
1381 | GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh
1382 |         huh, right.  Whoop!
1383 | ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in
1384 |         and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my
1385 |         first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you
1386 |         free.   (He holds out his hand)
1387 | GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
1388 |         O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a
1389 |         magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want
1390 |         most?
1391 | ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl--
1392 | GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a
1393 |         heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't
1394 |         make anybody fall in love, remember?
1395 | ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and...
1396 | GENIE:  Pretty?
1397 | ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and
1398 |         this hair, wow...and her smile.
1399 | GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)
1400 |         Ami.  C'est l'amour.
1401 | ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd
1402 |         have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?
1403 | GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh,
1404 |         chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a
1405 |         crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab?
1406 |         (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from
1407 |         "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I
1408 |         hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A
1409 |         dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu,
1410 |         Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at
1411 |         ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the
1412 |         words!
1413 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!
1414 | GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square
1415 |         shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes
1416 |         a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and
1417 |         vest combo is much too third century. These
1418 |         patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!
1419 |         Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's
1420 |         measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is
1421 |         outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy
1422 |         macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it
1423 |         say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse
1424 |         me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to
1425 |         cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and
1426 |         he flies over.)
1427 | ABU:        Uh oh!
1428 | GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game
1429 |         show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with
1430 |         "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your
1431 |         grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than
1432 |         riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out,
1433 |         it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it
1434 |         opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He
1435 |         spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the
1436 |         GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his
1437 |         fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.)
1438 |         Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need?
1439 |         (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning
1440 |         ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57
1441 |         Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's
1442 |         a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
1443 |         fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to
1444 |         normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!!
1445 |         (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns
1446 |         into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from
1447 |         under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk
1448 |         space, check this action out!
1449 | 
1450 | (ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
1451 |      The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU
1452 |      hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)
1453 | 
1454 | ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good.
1455 | GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but
1456 |         we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban,
1457 |         kid, cause we're gonna make you a star!
1458 | 
1459 | (We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks
1460 |     begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys.
1461 |     (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN
1462 |     balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top,
1463 |      then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the
1464 |     pile collapses.)
1465 | 
1466 | JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with
1467 |         your daughter.
1468 | IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
1469 | SULTAN: Oh, really?
1470 | JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess
1471 |         has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
1472 |         then the sultan shall choose for her."
1473 | SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to
1474 |         stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs
1475 |         away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker
1476 |         back.)  How could I choose someone she hates?
1477 |         (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
1478 |         cracker in his mouth.)
1479 | JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the
1480 |         event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess
1481 |         must then be wed to...hmm...interesting.
1482 | SULTAN: What?  Who?
1483 | JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!
1484 | SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can
1485 |         marry a princess, I'm quite sure.
1486 | JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my
1487 |         lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the
1488 |         SULTAN with it.)
1489 | SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
1490 | JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me.
1491 | SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell
1492 |         breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
1493 | JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
1494 |         me!
1495 | SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again
1496 |         broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince
1497 |         Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha.
1498 |         Jafar., you must come and see this!
1499 | 
1500 | (We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in
1501 |     human form as a MAJOR.)
1502 | 
1503 | MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali!
1504 | SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!
1505 | MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,
1506 |     Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star,
1507 |     Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
1508 |     Make way, here he comes,
1509 |     Ring bells, bang the drums.
1510 |     You're gonna love this guy
1511 | 
1512 | (The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)
1513 | 
1514 |     Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!
1515 |     Genuflect, show some respect
1516 |     Down on one knee
1517 | 
1518 | (ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)
1519 | 
1520 |     Now try your best to stay calm
1521 |     Brush up your Sunday Salaam
1522 |     And come and meet his spectacular coterie.
1523 | 
1524 | (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The
1525 |     MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand
1526 |     on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.)
1527 | 
1528 |     Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!
1529 |     Strong as ten regular men, definitely
1530 |     He faced the galloping hordes
1531 |     A hundred bad guys with swords
1532 |     Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!
1533 | 
1534 | (The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
1535 |     zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic
1536 |      wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child
1537 |     and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)
1538 | 
1539 | CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!
1540 | 
1541 | (In pops a typical parade commentator)
1542 | 
1543 | HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June?
1544 | 
1545 | CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!
1546 | 
1547 | (In comes another commentator.)
1548 | 
1549 | JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers!
1550 | 
1551 | GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down
1552 |             the parade)
1553 |     When it comes to exotic type mammals
1554 |     Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you
1555 |     It's a world class menagerie!
1556 | 
1557 | (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two
1558 |     lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony,
1559 |     where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)
1560 | 
1561 |     GENIE:
1562 |         GIRLS: (in couterpoint)
1563 |     Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
1564 |         There's no question this Ali's alluring
1565 |     That physique, how can I speak
1566 |         Never ordinary, never boring
1567 |     Weak at the knee
1568 |         Everything about the man just plain impresses
1569 |     Well, get on out in that square
1570 |         He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder
1571 |     Adjust your veil and prepare
1572 |         He's about to pull my heart asunder
1573 |     To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!
1574 |         And I absolutely love the way he dresses!
1575 | 
1576 | (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She
1577 |     humphs it off, then leaves.)
1578 | 
1579 | CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
1580 |     (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)
1581 |     And to view them, he charges no fee!
1582 |     (He's generous, so generous)
1583 |     He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies!
1584 |     (Proud to work for him)
1585 |     They bow to his whim, love serving him
1586 |     They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali!
1587 | 
1588 | (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to
1589 |     collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the
1590 |     palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door
1591 |     to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
1592 |     Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing
1593 |      JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)
1594 | 
1595 | GENIE:  Prince Ali!
1596 |     Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa
1597 |     Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!
1598 |     And that,good people, is why
1599 |     He got dolled up and dropped by
1600 |     With sixty elephants, llamas galore
1601 |     With his bears and lions
1602 |     A brass band and more
1603 |     With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
1604 |     His birds that warble on key
1605 |     Make way for Prince Ali!
1606 | 
1607 | (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back
1608 |     on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the
1609 |      door shut.)
1610 | 
1611 | SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.
1612 | ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have
1613 |             journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
1614 | SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to
1615 |         meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.)
1616 |         This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted
1617 |         too.
1618 | JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince
1619 |         Abooboo--
1620 | ALADDIN:    --Ababwa!
1621 | JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited
1622 |         and expect to--
1623 | SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
1624 |         (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his
1625 |         moustache.)  I don't suppose I might...
1626 | ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.
1627 | 
1628 | (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.
1629 |     JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)
1630 | 
1631 | JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this--
1632 | SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.
1633 | 
1634 | (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who
1635 |     was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly
1636 |      bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and
1637 |     CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,
1638 |      flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the
1639 |     background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)
1640 | 
1641 | JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from?
1642 | ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
1643 |         (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.)
1644 | JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)
1645 | SULTAN: Look out, Polly!
1646 | 
1647 | (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their
1648 |     heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)
1649 | 
1650 | IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!
1651 | 
1652 | (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and
1653 |     crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head
1654 |     is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker,
1655 |     have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)
1656 | 
1657 | SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar,
1658 |         watch this!  (He lands.)
1659 | JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness.
1660 | SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for
1661 |         it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then
1662 |         collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very
1663 |         impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers
1664 |         to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry
1665 |         Jasmine after all.
1666 | JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire.
1667 | SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm
1668 |         an excellent judge of character.
1669 | IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!
1670 | 
1671 | (JASMINE walks in quietly.)
1672 | 
1673 | SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
1674 | ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
1675 | JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's
1676 |         behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This
1677 |         boy is no different than the others.  What makes
1678 |         him think he is worthy of the princess?
1679 | ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks
1680 |         JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all
1681 |         directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win
1682 |         your daughter!
1683 | JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)
1684 |         All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I
1685 |         am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.)
1686 | SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give
1687 |         Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.)
1688 | JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince
1689 |         Abooboo.
1690 | 
1691 | (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find
1692 |     ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)
1693 | 
1694 | ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me
1695 |         talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull
1696 |         off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with
1697 |         his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes
1698 |         it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then
1699 |         tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the
1700 |         same.)
1701 | GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,
1702 |         knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey.
1703 |         That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
1704 |         can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug.
1705 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help.
1706 | GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the
1707 |         deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta
1708 |         be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?
1709 | ALADDIN:    What?
1710 | GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points
1711 |         out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her
1712 |         the...TRUTH!!!
1713 | ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some
1714 |         crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He
1715 |         puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)
1716 | GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
1717 |         (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.
1718 |         GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all
1719 |         joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.
1720 | ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,
1721 |         I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool,
1722 |         confident.  How do I look?
1723 | GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince.
1724 | 
1725 | (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed,
1726 |     sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)
1727 | 
1728 | ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?
1729 | 
1730 | (RAJAH looks up and growls.)
1731 | 
1732 | JASMINE:    Who's there?
1733 | ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
1734 |         deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
1735 | JASMINE:    I do not want to see you.
1736 | ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH
1737 |         growls and advances on him.)
1738 | JAFAR:  Just leave me alone.
1739 | ALADDIN:    Down kitty!
1740 | 
1741 | (Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)
1742 | 
1743 | GENIE:  How's our beau doing?
1744 | 
1745 | (CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)
1746 | 
1747 | ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off
1748 |         his turban to brush RAJAH away.)
1749 | JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him
1750 |         before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?
1751 | ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
1752 | JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
1753 | ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)
1754 |         I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.
1755 |         Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
1756 |         for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you
1757 |         met.
1758 | JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not.
1759 | BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk
1760 |         about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes.
1761 |         Anything--pick a feature!
1762 | ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very...
1763 | BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
1764 | ALADDIN:    Punctual!
1765 | JASMINE:    Punctual?
1766 | BEE:        Sorry.
1767 | ALADDIN:    Beautiful.
1768 | BEE:        Nice recovery.
1769 | JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know.
1770 | ALADDIN:    Yeah!
1771 | JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan
1772 | ALADDIN:    I know.
1773 | JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
1774 | ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.
1775 | BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
1776 | JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,
1777 |              swaggering, peacock I've met!
1778 | BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!
1779 |               Mayday!
1780 | JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
1781 | ALADDIN:    What?
1782 | BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
1783 | ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
1784 | BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into
1785 |              his turban)
1786 | ALADDIN:    Yeah, right!
1787 | JASMINE:    What!?!
1788 | ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be
1789 |         won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free
1790 |         to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look
1791 |         at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He
1792 |         steps up on the ledge and drops off.)
1793 | JASMINE:    No!
1794 | ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?
1795 | JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that?
1796 |         (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
1797 | ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet.
1798 | JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
1799 |         tassel.)
1800 | ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?
1801 |         We could get out of the palace, see the world.
1802 | JASMINE:    Is it safe?
1803 | ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me?
1804 | JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all-
1805 |         important line) What?
1806 | ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
1807 |         me?
1808 | JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.
1809 | 
1810 | (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky,
1811 |     knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole
1812 |      New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
1813 |     up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace
1814 |      wall and into the sky.)
1815 | 
1816 | ALADDIN:    I can show you the world
1817 |     Shining, shimmering, splendid.
1818 |     Tell me princess, now when did you last
1819 |     Let your heart decide?
1820 | 
1821 | (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a
1822 |     flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
1823 |       She smiles.)
1824 | 
1825 |     I can open your eyes
1826 |     Take you wonder by wonder
1827 |     Over, sideways, and under
1828 |     On a magic carpet ride
1829 | 
1830 | 
1831 | (CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)
1832 | 
1833 |     A whole new world!
1834 |     A new fantastic point of view
1835 |     No one to tell us no
1836 |     Or where to go
1837 |     Or say we're only dreaming
1838 | 
1839 | (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET
1840 |     flies in and out of the clouds.)
1841 | 
1842 | JASMINE:    A whole new world
1843 |     A dazzling place I never knew
1844 |     But when I'm way up here
1845 |     It's crystal clear
1846 |     That now I'm in a whole new world with you!
1847 | 
1848 | ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you!
1849 | 
1850 | (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It
1851 |     then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)
1852 | 
1853 | JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights
1854 |     Indescribable feeling
1855 |     Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
1856 |     Through an endless diamond sky
1857 | 
1858 | (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified
1859 |     and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting
1860 |     ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then
1861 |     zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)
1862 | 
1863 | JASMINE:    A whole new world!
1864 | ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes
1865 | JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see
1866 | ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better!
1867 | JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star,
1868 |     I've come so far
1869 |     I can't go back to where I used to be!
1870 | 
1871 | (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the
1872 |      ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker
1873 |      sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but
1874 |     chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)
1875 | 
1876 | ALADDIN:    A whole new world!
1877 | JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise
1878 | ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue
1879 | JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter
1880 | 
1881 | (They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.)
1882 | 
1883 | BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere
1884 |     There's time to spare
1885 |     Let me share this whole new world with you
1886 | 
1887 |     A whole new world
1888 |     That's where we'll be
1889 | 
1890 | (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
1891 |     tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure
1892 |     she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)
1893 | 
1894 | ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase
1895 | JASMINE:    A wondrous place
1896 | BOTH:       For you and me!
1897 | 
1898 | (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of
1899 |     the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple
1900 |     at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)
1901 | 
1902 | JASMINE:    It's all so magical.
1903 | ALADDIN:    Yeah.
1904 | JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
1905 |         It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
1906 | ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up
1907 |         realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really
1908 |         like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
1909 |         That is...oh no!
1910 | JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
1911 |         market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?
1912 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry.
1913 | JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid?
1914 | ALADDIN:    No!
1915 | JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out?
1916 | ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not
1917 |         what I meant.
1918 | JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
1919 | ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,
1920 |         giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I
1921 |         sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the
1922 |         pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in
1923 |         defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on
1924 |          his turban falls down over his eyes.)
1925 | JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me?
1926 | ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the
1927 |         city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,
1928 |         don't you think?
1929 | JASMINE:    Not that strange.
1930 | 
1931 | (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a
1932 |     tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext.
1933 |     of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET
1934 |     forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends
1935 |      just below the balcony.)
1936 | 
1937 | JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince.
1938 | ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess.
1939 | 
1940 | (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they
1941 |     kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and
1942 |     looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)
1943 | 
1944 | ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends
1945 |         to the ground.) For the first time in my life,
1946 |         things are starting to go right.
1947 | 
1948 | (He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)
1949 | 
1950 | ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.
1951 |         Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant
1952 |         hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
1953 | GUARD:  Hold him!
1954 | 
1955 | (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties
1956 |     CARPET in a knot around a tree.)
1957 | 
1958 | JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince
1959 |         Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's
1960 |         never found.
1961 | 
1962 | (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a
1963 |     cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water.
1964 |       He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock
1965 |      hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles
1966 |     out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he
1967 |     loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled
1968 |     by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,
1969 |     and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)
1970 | 
1971 | GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at
1972 |         the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees
1973 |         unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!
1974 |         You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you
1975 |         unless you make a wish.  You have to say  "Genie I
1976 |         want you to save my life."  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon
1977 |         Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
1978 |         shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll
1979 |         take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.)
1980 |         Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up
1981 |         scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like
1982 |         German.  On the surface, a giant water spout
1983 |         emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN
1984 |         reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.)
1985 |         Don't you scare me like that!
1986 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say
1987 |         it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie.
1988 | GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not
1989 |         that I want to pick out curtains or anything.
1990 | 
1991 | (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing
1992 |    her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)
1993 | 
1994 | SULTAN: Jasmine!
1995 | JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time.
1996 |         I'm so happy.
1997 | SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,
1998 |         Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
1999 | JASMINE:    What?
2000 | SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will
2001 |         wed Jafar.
2002 | 
2003 | (JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)
2004 | 
2005 | JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a
2006 |         wife.
2007 | JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN)
2008 |         Father, I choose Prince Ali!
2009 | JAFAR:  Prince Ali left!
2010 | 
2011 | (A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)
2012 | 
2013 | ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!
2014 | JASMINE:    Prince Ali!
2015 | 
2016 | (JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)
2017 | 
2018 | IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
2019 | ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me
2020 |         killed.
2021 | JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous
2022 |         nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.
2023 |         (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.)
2024 | SULTAN: Obviously...lying.
2025 | 
2026 | (ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)
2027 | 
2028 | JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you?
2029 | ALADDIN:    I know!
2030 | 
2031 | (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches
2032 |     and the spell is broken for good.)
2033 | 
2034 | SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!
2035 | ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with
2036 |         this!  (He advances the staff)
2037 | SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!
2038 | 
2039 | (The trio advances on JAFAR.)
2040 | 
2041 | JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained.
2042 | SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
2043 | IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just
2044 |         dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead.
2045 | 
2046 | (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but
2047 |     is grabbed by guards.)
2048 | 
2049 | SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
2050 | JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy!
2051 | 
2052 | (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes
2053 |     him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud
2054 |     appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)
2055 | 
2056 | SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere!
2057 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right?
2058 | JASMINE:    Yes.
2059 | 
2060 | (They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)
2061 | 
2062 | SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against
2063 |         me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever-
2064 |         (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)
2065 |         Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a
2066 |         suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You
2067 |         brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll
2068 |         leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once!
2069 |         Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and
2070 |         then my boy, you will be sultan!
2071 | ALADDIN:    Sultan?
2072 | SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a
2073 |         person of your unimpeachable moral character is
2074 |         exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks
2075 |         concerned at this.)
2076 | 
2077 | (Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.)
2078 | 
2079 | IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta
2080 |         start packing, your highness.  Only essentials.
2081 |         (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
2082 |         JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the
2083 |         guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out
2084 |         a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about
2085 |         this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a
2086 |         weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.)
2087 |         Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO
2088 |         flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar?
2089 |         Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around
2090 |         the neck) Good grip!
2091 | JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin
2092 |         Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago.
2093 | IAGO:       Why that miserable--
2094 | JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it!
2095 | IAGO:       Me?
2096 | 
2097 | (Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)
2098 | 
2099 | ALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?
2100 | 
2101 | (GENIE comes out of lamp)
2102 | 
2103 | GENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a
2104 |         one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his
2105 |         head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up
2106 |         with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds
2107 |         up his hands like a director scoping a picture and
2108 |         we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won
2109 |         the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do
2110 |         next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in
2111 |         sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs.
2112 |         GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls
2113 |         out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering: )
2114 |         Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie."
2115 |         Anytime.
2116 | ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't.
2117 | GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go "Genie, I wish you
2118 |         free."  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
2119 |         him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)
2120 | ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But
2121 |         they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make
2122 |         Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
2123 | GENIE:  Al, you won!
2124 | ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm
2125 |         anything is because of you.  What if they find out
2126 |         I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if
2127 |         Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't
2128 |         keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free.
2129 | GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all,
2130 |         you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning
2131 |         to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me,
2132 |         master. (He says the last word in disgust, then
2133 |         poofs back into the lamp.)
2134 | 
2135 | (ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)
2136 | 
2137 | ABU:        Ohhh.
2138 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the
2139 |         spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams
2140 |         a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in
2141 |         there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you
2142 |         guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm
2143 |         sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't--
2144 |         wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing?
2145 |         Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
2146 | JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
2147 | ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks
2148 |         into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you?
2149 | 
2150 | (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
2151 |     in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)
2152 | 
2153 | IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.
2154 | ALADDIN:    I'm coming.
2155 | 
2156 | (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs,
2157 |     then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is
2158 |     panting.)
2159 | 
2160 | FLAMINGO:   D'uh!
2161 | IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's
2162 |         feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace
2163 |         and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's
2164 |         gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face
2165 |         like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago!
2166 |         (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale
2167 |         of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,
2168 |         Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm
2169 |         blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.)
2170 | 
2171 | (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making
2172 |     an announcement to the people.)
2173 | 
2174 | SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a
2175 |         suitor!
2176 | 
2177 | (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN
2178 |     appears at the bottom of the stairs.)
2179 | 
2180 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine?
2181 | JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been?
2182 | ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you.
2183 | JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's
2184 |         announcement!
2185 | ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
2186 | JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform
2187 |         with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire
2188 |         crowd.)
2189 | SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!
2190 | ALADDIN:    Oh, boy!
2191 | 
2192 | (Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)
2193 | 
2194 | IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
2195 | JAFAR:  Let them cheer.
2196 | 
2197 |  (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.)
2198 | 
2199 | GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR)
2200 |         reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He
2201 |         descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the
2202 |         role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and
2203 |         sinister ugly man.
2204 | JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the
2205 |         ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)
2206 | GENIE:  I was afraid of that.
2207 | JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on
2208 |         high, as sultan!!!
2209 | 
2210 | (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes.
2211 |     The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)
2212 | 
2213 | ALADDIN:    Whoa!
2214 | SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?
2215 | 
2216 | (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body
2217 |     flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer
2218 |      shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)
2219 | 
2220 | JAFAR:  Heh heh heh!
2221 | SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.
2222 | IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
2223 | ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls
2224 |         off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!
2225 | JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo.
2226 | 
2227 | (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into
2228 |     the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him.
2229 |       They fly up near the GENIE's head.)
2230 | 
2231 | ALADDIN:    Genie!  No!
2232 | GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the
2233 |         palace on top of a mountain.)
2234 | SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
2235 | JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you
2236 |         will bow to me!
2237 | 
2238 | (The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)
2239 | 
2240 | JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you!
2241 | IAGO:       Why am I not surprised?
2242 | JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will
2243 |         cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my
2244 |         second wish--I wish to be the most powerful
2245 |         sorcerer in the world!
2246 | 
2247 | (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,
2248 |     and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR,
2249 |      returning him to his normal look.)
2250 | 
2251 | IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for
2252 |         Sorcerer Jafar!
2253 | JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!
2254 |         (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and
2255 |         they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him.
2256 |         He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-
2257 |         cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin
2258 |         with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to
2259 |         introduce you to.
2260 | ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!
2261 | 
2262 | (JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.)
2263 | 
2264 | JAFAR:  Prince Ali
2265 |     Yes, it is he,
2266 |     But not as you know him.
2267 |     Read my lips and come to grips
2268 |     With reality
2269 | 
2270 | (JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.)
2271 | 
2272 |     Yes, meet a blast from your past
2273 |     Whose lies were too good to last
2274 |     Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!
2275 | 
2276 | (JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)
2277 | 
2278 | IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin?
2279 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
2280 | 
2281 | JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
2282 |     Just a con, need I go on?
2283 |     Take it from me
2284 |     His personality flaws
2285 |     Give me adequate cause
2286 |     To send him packing on a one-way trip
2287 |     So his prospects take a terminal dip
2288 |     His assets frozen, the venue chosen
2289 |     Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
2290 |     So long,
2291 | IAGO:       Good bye, see ya!
2292 | JAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali!
2293 | 
2294 | (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into
2295 |     a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before
2296 |     CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
2297 |     the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop.
2298 |     ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)
2299 | 
2300 | ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of
2301 |         snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have
2302 |         freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs
2303 |         out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu!
2304 |         Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of
2305 |         everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set
2306 |         things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow,
2307 |         and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.)
2308 |         Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by
2309 |         the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He
2310 |         can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the
2311 |         base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's
2312 |         it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and
2313 |         the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away,
2314 |         looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar
2315 |         rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and
2316 |         ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by
2317 |         the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He
2318 |         looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.
2319 |         CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick
2320 |         them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go!
2321 | 
2322 | (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.
2323 |     Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN
2324 |     tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the
2325 |     throne.)
2326 | 
2327 | IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker.
2328 |         Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have
2329 |         lots!
2330 | 
2331 | (JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)
2332 | 
2333 | JAFAR:  Leave him alone!
2334 | 
2335 | (IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)
2336 | 
2337 | JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
2338 |         (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.)
2339 |         A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be
2340 |         on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
2341 |         (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do
2342 |         you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen...
2343 | 
2344 | (She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)
2345 | 
2346 | JASMINE:    Never!
2347 | JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he
2348 |         raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No.
2349 |         Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I
2350 |         wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in
2351 |         love with me.
2352 | 
2353 | (We see ALADDIN race back into town.)
2354 | 
2355 | GENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few
2356 |         addendas, some quid pro quo-
2357 | JAFAR:  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You
2358 |         will do what I order you to do, slave!
2359 | 
2360 | (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to
2361 |     play along.)
2362 | 
2363 | JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.)
2364 |         Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly
2365 |         handsome you are.
2366 | 
2367 | (The GENIE's jaw drops.)
2368 | 
2369 | JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a
2370 |         shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more
2371 |         about...myself.
2372 | JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed...
2373 | 
2374 | (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE
2375 |     sees them.)
2376 | 
2377 | GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy!
2378 | ALADDIN:    Shh!
2379 | GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)
2380 |         Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath,
2381 |         now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.)
2382 | ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's
2383 |         mouth.)  I'll improvise.
2384 | 
2385 | (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE.
2386 |     JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.)
2387 | 
2388 | JAFAR:  Go on.
2389 | JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her
2390 |         arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her
2391 |         finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN
2392 |         to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)
2393 | 
2394 | IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
2395 | JAFAR:  And the street rat?
2396 | JASMINE:    What street rat?
2397 | 
2398 | (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR
2399 |     turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN
2400 |      looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)
2401 | 
2402 | ABU:        Yuck!
2403 | JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her
2404 |         crown.) You!!  How many times do I have
2405 |         to kill you, boy?
2406 | 
2407 |  (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the
2408 |     ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)
2409 | 
2410 | ALADDIN:    Get the lamp!
2411 | 
2412 | (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then
2413 |     zaps her into an hourglass.)
2414 | 
2415 | JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!
2416 | 
2417 | (Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)
2418 | 
2419 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine!
2420 | IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)
2421 | 
2422 | (ABU rushes for the lamp.)
2423 | 
2424 | JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey.
2425 | ALADDIN:    Abu!
2426 | 
2427 | 
2428 | (CARPET rushes in.)
2429 | 
2430 | JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is
2431 |         zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the
2432 |         lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by
2433 |         large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs
2434 |         the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
2435 |         sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed
2436 |         up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
2437 | ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly
2438 |         snake?
2439 | JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how
2440 |         snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we
2441 |         see a snake's tongue come out from behind his
2442 |         teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the
2443 |         ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the
2444 |         snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes
2445 |         moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN
2446 |         swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE
2447 |         cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)
2448 | 
2449 | GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into
2450 |         that snake!
2451 | JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss!
2452 | 
2453 | (GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)
2454 | 
2455 | GENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
2456 |         GREAT!
2457 | 
2458 | (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
2459 |     JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path.
2460 |      ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)
2461 | 
2462 | JASMINE:    Aladdin!
2463 | 
2464 | (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing
2465 |     the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake
2466 |     cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
2467 |     hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back
2468 |      and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to
2469 |      free the princess.)
2470 | 
2471 | ALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine!
2472 | 
2473 | (He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)
2474 | 
2475 | JAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought
2476 |         you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!
2477 | IAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
2478 |         Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him
2479 |         out of the way)
2480 | JAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing!
2481 | ALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie
2482 |         has more power than you'll ever have!
2483 | JAFAR:  What!!
2484 | ALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away!
2485 | GENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me
2486 |         into this?
2487 | ALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!
2488 | JAFAR:  You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But
2489 |         not for long!
2490 | 
2491 | (JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)
2492 | 
2493 | GENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One
2494 |         too many hits with the snake  (His hand
2495 |         turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
2496 | JAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all
2497 |         powerful genie!
2498 | GENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command.
2499 |         Way to go, Al.
2500 | 
2501 | (GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt.
2502 |     JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We
2503 |      see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN
2504 |     runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess
2505 |      pour out.)
2506 | 
2507 | JAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!
2508 | JASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
2509 | ALADDIN:    Trust me!
2510 | 
2511 | (A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.)
2512 | 
2513 | JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control!
2514 | ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something?
2515 |     (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you
2516 |     got it!  And everything that goes with it!
2517 | 
2518 | (Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.)
2519 | 
2520 | JAFAR:  No!  No!
2521 | IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the
2522 |         genie, I don't want--
2523 | 
2524 | (IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)
2525 | 
2526 | ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.
2527 | GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you!
2528 | 
2529 | (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN
2530 |     and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of
2531 |      the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed
2532 |      because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears
2533 |      where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the
2534 |     new lamp.)
2535 | 
2536 | JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak
2537 |         out of my face!
2538 | IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron!
2539 | JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up!
2540 | GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the
2541 |         balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He
2542 |         winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his
2543 |         palm flat and flicks it out into the desert
2544 |         with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of
2545 |         wonders ought to chill him out!
2546 | 
2547 | (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks
2548 |     over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)
2549 | 
2550 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a
2551 |         prince.
2552 | JASMINE:    I know why you did.
2553 | ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes
2554 |         his head around the corner shocked at what he is
2555 |         hearing.)
2556 | JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you.
2557 | GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still
2558 |         got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a
2559 |         prince again.
2560 | ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom?
2561 | GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is
2562 |         love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're
2563 |         not gonna find another girl like her in a million
2564 |         years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked.
2565 | ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop
2566 |         pretending to be something I'm not.
2567 | JASMINE:    I understand.
2568 | 
2569 | (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns
2570 |     to the GENIE.)
2571 | 
2572 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom.
2573 | GENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?
2574 | ALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you're
2575 |         free!
2576 | 
2577 | (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off
2578 |     GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground.
2579 |      GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)
2580 | 
2581 | GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm
2582 |         free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick,
2583 |         quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  "I want
2584 |         the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!
2585 | ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile.
2586 | GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around
2587 |         the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel
2588 |         good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin'
2589 |         the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I--
2590 | 
2591 | (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
2592 |     very sad.)
2593 | 
2594 | ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you.
2595 | GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll
2596 |         always be a prince to me.
2597 | 
2598 | (They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.)

2600 | SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth
2601 |         as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the
2602 |         problem.
2603 | JASMINE:    Father?
2604 | SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day
2605 |         forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems
2606 |         worthy.
2607 | JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
2608 |         Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin.
2609 | ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al.
2610 | 
2611 | (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together.
2612 |     GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
2613 |      hat.)
2614 | 
2615 | GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug!
2616 |         Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh,
2617 |         hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around
2618 |         this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye,
2619 |         you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm
2620 |         history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care
2621 |         what I am--I'm free!
2622 | 
2623 | (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles
2624 |     behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse)
2625 |      to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see
2626 |      ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)
2627 | 
2628 | ALADDIN:    A whole new world
2629 | JASMINE:        A whole new life
2630 | BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me!
2631 | MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world!
2632 | 
2633 | (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared,
2634 |     the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly
2635 |     the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up
2636 |      and looks at the audience.)
2637 | 
2638 | GENIE:  Made ya look!
2639 | 
2640 | (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black.
2641 |     The end.)
